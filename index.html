        <p><b>I am taking a very minimalistic approach to web design for a couple reasons:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy to locate, read, and download information</li>
            <li>Encorages me to focus on adding new content, rather than adding appeal or uneeded features</li>
            <li>Easy to make ;)</li>
